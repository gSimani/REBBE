The Rebbe's View on Technology

The Lubavitcher Rebbe had a unique perspective on technology and its role in divine service. He often emphasized that everything in the world was created for a divine purpose, including modern technological advances.

Key Points:
1. Technology should be used to spread Torah and Judaism
2. Every invention has a spiritual lesson we can learn from
3. Modern communications show how one action can instantly affect the whole world
4. We should use technology to increase in acts of goodness and kindness

The Rebbe demonstrated this by:
- Broadcasting farbrengens via satellite
- Encouraging use of radio and television for kosher purposes
- Embracing new methods of communication to reach more Jews
- Using modern printing methods to publish Jewish texts
